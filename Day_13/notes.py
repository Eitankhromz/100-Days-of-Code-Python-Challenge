# # Describe Problem
# def my_function():
#   for i in range(1, 20): #Range goes from 1 to 20 but not including 20 so print statement will never be executed; '20' needs to be changed to '21'
#     if i == 20:
#       print("You got it")
# my_function()

# # Reproduce the Bug
# from random import randint
# dice_imgs = ["❶", "❷", "❸", "❹", "❺", "❻"]
# dice_num = randint(0, 5) #Picks a random integer between index 1 and 6 including 6. However indexes start at 0 and there are only 5 of them so randint(0, 5)
# print(dice_imgs[dice_num])

# # Play Computer
# year = int(input("What's your year of birth?"))
# if year > 1980 and year < 1994:
#   print("You are a millenial.")
# elif year >= 1994:
#   print("You are a Gen Z.")

# # Fix the Errors
# age = int(input("How old are you?"))
# if age > 18:
#   print(f"You can drive at age {age}.")
# else:
#   print(f"You cannot drive at age {age}.")

# #Print is Your Friend
# pages = 0
# word_per_page = 0
# pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
# word_per_page = int(input("Number of words per page: "))
# total_words = pages * word_per_page
# print(total_words)
